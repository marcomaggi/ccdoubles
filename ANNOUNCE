Subject: [announce] CCDoubles revision 0.1d2

			       CCDoubles
			       =========


This  package  installs  a  C99  language  library  implementing  simple
routines  for vectors  and  matrices of  "double"  and "double  complex"
values.   This  library is  meant  to  be  used  as companion  for  more
sophisticated libraries such as CBLAS and LAPACKE.

  The package  makes use  of the  GNU Autotools  and it  is tested  on a
GNU+Linux  system.   It is  distributed  under  the GNU  General  Public
License version 3.0.

  The latest release of this package can be downloaded from:

	 <https://bitbucket.org/marcomaggi/ccdoubles/downloads>

development takes place at:

	       <http://github.com/marcomaggi/ccdoubles/>

and as backup at:

	     <https://bitbucket.org/marcomaggi/ccdoubles/>

the documentation is available online:

Notes for revision 0.1d2
------------------------

* Added subvector functions:

   ccdoubles_real_vector_copy_forward()
   ccdoubles_real_vector_copy_backward()
   ccdoubles_cplx_vector_copy_forward()
   ccdoubles_cplx_vector_copy_backward()

* Added matrix row and column copy functions:

   ccdoubles_real_matrix_row_to_row()
   ccdoubles_real_matrix_col_to_col()


Notes for revision 0.1d1
------------------------

* Some documentation improvement.

* Changed  types  of  function   parameters.   It  should  be  backwards
  compatible.


Notes for revision 0.1d0
------------------------

* This is the first release, only basic functions available.

* Some of  the missing functions:  element swap; row swap;  column swap;
  CBLAS and  LAPACKE need  some auxiliary functions  to show  results in
  human-readable format.

* The  directory  "scheme"  contains  a table  of  functions  in  Scheme
  symbolic expression form and a  demo program that automatically builds
  a Vicare Scheme binding for  CCDoubles.  It should be easily adaptable
  to other Scheme implementations.
